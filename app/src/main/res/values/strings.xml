    <string name="healthcheck_date_added_desc">Date when lab results were added</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_creative_protein_desc">C-reactive protein is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called \"acute phase reactants\" that go up in response to inflammation.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_date_gfr_desc">Your GFR tells how much kidney function you have. It may be estimated from your blood level of creatinine. If your GFR falls below 30 you will need to see a kidney disease specialist (called a nephrologist), Your kidney doctor will speak to you about treatments for kidney failure like dialysis or kidney transplant. A GFR below 15 indicates that you need to start one of these treatments.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_iron_desc">Iron helps your body in many ways. One
way is to help make red blood cells. Red
blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to
all parts of your body, giving you the energy
you need for your daily activities. The kidneys signal the body to make
enough red blood cells, and iron helps in
making them healthy red blood cells. </string>
    <string name="healthcheck_transferrin_desc">A plasma protein that transports iron through the blood to the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Transferrin is the main transport protein to which iron is bound in the blood.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_satn_transferrin_desc">Transferrin saturation - this is a calculation that represents the percentage of transferrin that is saturated with iron.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_phosphate_desc">A high phosphorus level can lead to weak bones. Ask your doctor what your phosphorus level should be. If your level is too high, your doctor may ask you to reduce your intake of foods that are high in phosphorus and take a type of medication called a phosphate binder with your meals and snacks.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_bicarbonate_desc">Bicarbonate is an electrolyte, a negatively charged ion that is used by the body to help maintain the body\'s acid-base (pH) balance.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_ferritin_desc">Ferritin is an iron-containing protein and is the primary form of iron stored inside of cells. The small quantity of ferritin that is released into the blood is a reflection of the amount of total iron stored in the body.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_glucose_desc">Glucose is the primary energy source for the body\'s cells and the only energy source for the brain and nervous system.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_magnesium_desc">Magnesium is a mineral that is vital for energy production, muscle contraction, nerve function, and the maintenance of strong bones.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_sodium_desc">Sodium is an electrolyte present in all body fluids and is vital to normal body function, including nerve and muscle function. </string>
    <string name="healthcheck_potassium_desc">Potassium is a mineral in your blood that helps your heart and muscles work properly. A potassium level that is too high or too low may weaken muscles and change your heartbeat. Whether you need to change the amount of high- potassium foods in your diet depends on your stage of kidney disease.Your dietitian can help you plan your diet to get the right amount of potassium.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_urea_desc">Urea is a waste product formed in the liver when protein is metabolized into its component parts (amino acids) . This process produces ammonia, which is then converted into the less toxic waste product urea. </string>
    <string name="healthcheck_creatinine_desc">Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys, which filter almost all of it from the blood and release it into the urine. </string>
    <string name="healthcheck_alt_desc">Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found mostly in the cells of the liver and kidney. Much smaller amounts of it are also found in the heart and muscles. In healthy individuals, ALT levels in the blood are low. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the bloodstream, usually before more obvious signs of liver damage occur, such as jaundice. This makes ALT a useful test for detecting liver damage.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_bilirubins_desc">Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment, a waste product primarily produced by the normal breakdown of heme. Heme is a component of hemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells (RBCs). Bilirubin is ultimately processed by the liver to allow its elimination from the body.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_alkaline_phosphatase_desc">Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in several tissues throughout the body, including liver, bone, kidney, bowel (intestine), and in the placenta of women who are pregnant. The highest concentrations of ALP are present in the cells that comprise bone and the liver. </string>
    <string name="healthcheck_albumin_desc">Albumin is a type of body protein made from the protein you eat each day. A low level of albumin in your blood may be caused by not getting enough protein or calories from your diet. A low level of albumin may lead to health problems such as difficulty fighting off infections.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_calcium_desc">Calcium is a mineral that is important for strong bones. Ask your doctor what your calcium level should be. To help balance the amount of calcium in your blood, your doctor may ask you to take calcium supplements and a special prescription form of vitamin D. Take only the supplements and medications recommended by your doctor.</string>
    <string name="healthcheck_calcium_corrected_desc">Additional confirmatory test for hypercalcemia(ionized calcium level).</string>
