Everyday mobile application for renal dialysis patients

Project description
The mobile application provides renal dialysis patients with essential information before, during and after their treatment, 
which is explained within the app. This includes relevant medical information such as the access to recent blood 
pressure records/recent weight records/blood test results. It also will provide patients with the essential everyday information, 
such as the name and number of their doctor and consultant, their location within the hospital and frequently asked questions that 
will prepare patients for their treatment, throughout their treatment and in their aftercare.

The application also provides tools for personal uses such as a calendar of events, reminders for patients appointments and 
treatment and other essential events. One of the key functionalities of this application will be to carry out a daily check 
of all records and attempt to find any illness patterns, helping to diagnose health problems early and prevent them in the future. 
In addition to that, the application will have an ability to check the most vulnerable place of renal dialysis patients - their fistula. 

The feature is working by reminding patients to take a picture of their fistula every day, which will then be processed in an attempt to 
find any illness patterns, which will help significantly in diagnosing problems early - serving as a valuable preventative measure.
